In this workshop, I practice the skill of virtual functions in inheritance and I/O.

First of all, I need to walk through the Person class using the nameTester.cpp program understood how it works. I created a class module called Contact, derived from the Person class. 

I created some function belong to Contact, override all the virtual functions and virtual operators of the Person class. Also, I implement the rule of three.

Secondly, I use the Utils function for my C-string, such as strCpy() and dynamic memory allocation, such as delAlloCopy(). 

I did not feel much difficulty during the last milestone. However, the key point of this milestone was to properly understand the functions and classes I had implemented before and to understand the inheritance relationship between the classes.
