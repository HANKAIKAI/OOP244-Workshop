I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I practice the skill of virtual functions in inheritance. I created baseShape module, which has a baseShape class inside and it is an interface, an abstract base class with only pure virtual functions. It has two pure virtual functions: drawShape and readShape. Besides, its destructor is also virtual.
Other than baseShape module, I also created labelShape module, lineLabel module and rectangleLabel module. labelShape module is based on baseShape module and lineLabel module and rectangleLabel module have concrete class lineLabel and rectangleLabel inside and they are based on labelShape module. The goal of this workshop is to make lines and rectangles.
While doing this workshop, I noticed that although I do the workshop successfully, I cannot complete the workshop without instructions. That is, if the instruction did not make those module for us, I have no idea how to separate the work into different module with base classes and concrete classes. It's hard to design these kind of things before doing any projects. Therefore, I think it will be a good practice to think carefully and deeply before doing any projects.
